# the-zen-zone-client
This is the client for the Zen Zone. The Zen Zone is a web app that provides many calming ambient sound scapes to help you sleep, study, relax or just have a moment of peace. This repo holds the ReactJS based client.

## To do
- [x] Fix Soundscape font for better readability
- [ ] Add animated dropdown for mobile (again?!)
- [x] Fix the issue where the Soundscape Unit spills into the header
- [ ] When you click add on a sound, it redirects you to the home page and does not remove the sound from the list
