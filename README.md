## Overview

Let an array of soundscapes transport you from your office or classroom to a completely different world with The Zen Zone. The Zen Zone is a soundscape generator designed to help you relax, focus, and tune unpleasant sounds from your environment. The modular design allows you to combine multiple soundscapes to create your very own custom mixes. For example, you could combine fire, river, and birds to create the ambiance of a camping trip. After creating an account, users can also save favourite soundscapes, save mixes and share mixes with friends. All soundscapes have been recorded by me with my H4N Zoom Microphone.  

## Features

- Modular design that allows users to create custom mixes
